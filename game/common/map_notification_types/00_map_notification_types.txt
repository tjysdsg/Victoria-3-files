# message: loc key of the message to show on the map at the location specified in code. Can be overridden from code and omitted in these cases.
# widget: name of the widget that should be shown when the notification spawns. Default is "map_event_notification".
# max_height: the maximum zoom level this notification will still show at. Default is set by NGUI:MAP_NOTIFICATIONS_MAX_ZOOM define. Somewhat strange name, but it's the max value if not specified differently (in this file right here). A negative value means it will show at any zoom. Note that open lenses block all map notifications.
# max_height values should usually be one of these as they specify our zoom steps (as defined in NCamera defines): ZOOM_STEPS = {24 32 40 50 75 100 200 300 400 600 800 1000 1200 1500 2500 4500}
# sound: the sound to play when the message spawns on the map, assuming it's visible to the player. Can be omitted.
